This repository gathers informations about my usage of obsidian.

## Templates

In the `templates` sub-directory, you'll find a copy of my currently used templates for
Obsidian. My templates use the French language. Using LLM, you could easily translate them
into your native language.

The templates need the following Obsidian plugins to be installed :
- [Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater)
- [ProgressBar](https://github.com/zwpaper/obsidian-progressbar)
- [Tasks](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks)
- [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview)
